# Parking-Garage
 No really, its a parking garage



I have absolutely no idea why I decided to make this
to be completely honest. This was nothing but boring
and at no point throughout making this was I having
a good time.... however, it works, for the most part.
I haven't found any bugs within this project yet. It
is not a finished product, and I may go back to work
on it and complete it in the near future, but for now
I'm done working on it. There are a lot of code remnants
for things that I had planned to do but never ended
up actually doing, and that I may go back and do some
time soon. Two of the buttons on the floor-view page
do not have functionality because I lost all motivation
for this project in the middle of making them. Besides
that this was intended to be pretty user friendly and 
the controls are pretty straightforward, I think. Anyway
uh... parking garage
